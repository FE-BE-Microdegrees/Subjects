## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. In the past, Javascript was used only on the client-side (in the browser). Nowadays, Javascript is also used on the server-side (in Node JS). If we want to create a interactive web page or a web application, we need to use Javascript and on top of that, Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## History of Javascript

Javascript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was originally called Mocha, then it was renamed to LiveScript, and finally it was renamed to Javascript. The name Javascript was chosen because Java was very popular at that time and the name Javascript was used to attract Java developers to use Javascript.

## How to run Javascript?

There are multiple ways to run Javascript. We can save the Javascript code in a file and run it using Node JS or we can run it in the browser. We can also run Javascript code in the browser console.

## How to write Javascript?

In order to write Javascript, we need to open a text editor and type the Javascript code. We can save the file as `fileName.js` and run it using Node JS or we can run it in the browser.

## Running Javascript in Node JS

In order to run Javascript in Node JS, we need to open a terminal and type `node fileName.js` in the terminal, where `fileName.js` is the name of the file that contains the Javascript code.
