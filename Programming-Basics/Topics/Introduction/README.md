## What is the aim of this subject?

The aim of this subject is to intorduce you to the world of programming. We will learn the basics of programming and how to start writing code.

This subject will be the foundation to all other subjects in this course. It will help you to understand the basics of programming and how to write code. It will also help you to understand the concepts of programming languages and how they work.

## What is Programming and why does it matter?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform a task. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language that can be translated into machine code (i.e., binary) and executed by a computer. Programming is a creative process that involves designing algorithms and developing code to solve problems. It is a skill that is in high demand in today's digital world, and it is a skill that can be learned by anyone.

## What we will learn in this subject?

In this subject, we will learn the basics of programming. We will learn about:
- variables;
- data types;
- control structures;
- operators and expressions;
- loops;
- functions;
- basic algorithm development.

We will also learn how to write and debug our first lines of code, paving the way for more advanced studies in software development and computer science.

## What language will we use?

There are lot of different programming languages out there, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are considered easier to learn than others, while some are more powerful and flexible. For this course, we will use JavaScript, which is a popular programming language that is used for both front-end and back-end development. It is not considered as a best language to learn programming, but this course is all about web development and nowaday JavaScript is a must-have skill for web developers.

## What tools will we use?

As every work needs tools, programming also needs tools. We will use different tools and application to write, run, manage and store our code.
Our main tools will be:
- Code editor
- Node.js
- Browser
- Git
- Github
- ...

We will talk about tools we will use according to subjects as we go on.
