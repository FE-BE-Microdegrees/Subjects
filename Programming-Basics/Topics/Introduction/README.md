# Introduction

## What is Programming and why does it matter?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform a task. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language that can be translated into machine code (i.e., binary) and executed by a computer. Programming is a creative process that involves designing algorithms and developing code to solve problems. It is a skill that is in high demand in today's digital world, and it is a skill that can be learned by anyone.
