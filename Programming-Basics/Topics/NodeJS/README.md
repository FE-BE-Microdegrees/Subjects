## What is Node JS?

Javascript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. It is a client-side language, which means that it runs in the browser. Node JS is a runtime environment that allows us to run Javascript code outside of the browser. Node JS is a server-side language, which means that it runs on the server. Node JS is built on top of the V8 Javascript engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser.

## Why Use Node JS?

Node JS is a popular choice for building web applications because it is fast, scalable, and easy to learn and it is possible to use same language (Javascript) on both the client-side and the server-side. Node JS is also popular because it has a large community of developers and a large number of open-source libraries that can be used to build web applications.

Node JS is not only for building web applications. It can also be used to build desktop applications, mobile applications, and even IoT applications.

## How to Install Node JS?

In order to install Node JS, we need to download the Node JS installer from the [official Node JS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The installer will install Node JS and NPM (Node Package Manager) on our computer. NPM is a tool that is used to install and manage Node JS packages.

## How to Run Node JS?

In order to run Node JS, we need to open a terminal and type `node` followed by the name of the file that we want to run. For example, if we have a file named `index.js`, we can run it by typing `node index.js` in the terminal.
