# Front-End Frameworks

**Front-End frameworks** are software development frameworks that assist developers in creating user interfaces. These frameworks provide pre-built components, style guides, and other abstractions that enable developers to build user interfaces faster and more efficiently.

## Description

**Front-End Frameworks** help students understand and apply modern web application development principles and techniques. This course focuses on the ReactJS framework, one of the most popular and widely used front-end frameworks today. Students will learn how to create dynamic and interactive web applications using ReactJS components, state management, routing, and other essential concepts.

- **Credits**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Lectures**: 2 x 8 hours in-person + 3 x 4 hours online
