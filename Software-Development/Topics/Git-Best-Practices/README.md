## Learning Outcomes

After completing this topic, you will be able to:

- Describe the best practices for using Git and GitHub;
- Apply Git and GitHub best practices in a software development project.

Using Git and GitHub effectively involves more than just knowing the commands and tools. Following best practices ensures that the development process is smooth, the project history remains clean, and team collaboration is efficient.

Here is an overview of the best practices for both Git and GitHub:

## Git Best Practices

1. **Commit Often, Push Less Frequently:**
   - Make frequent, smaller commits that cover a single logical change (e.g., fixing a bug or adding a feature). This makes it easier to understand the history and isolate issues.
2. **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:**
   - Start with a short, descriptive title. If more detail is needed, add a thorough description in the body. This helps other developers understand why the change was made and how it affects the codebase.
3. **Use Branches:**
   - Never work directly on the `main` or `master` branch. Use feature branches for each new feature or bug fix.
   - Delete branches after merging them to keep the repository clean.
4. **Avoid Changing Published History:**
   - Once commits are pushed to a branch, avoid using commands that rewrite history (e.g., `rebase` or `force push`), unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.
5. **Synchronize Regularly:**
   - Pull frequently from the main repository to integrate changes and resolve conflicts early.
6. **Resolve Conflicts Immediately:**
   - Address and resolve merge conflicts as soon as they arise.
7. **Use a `.gitignore` File:**
   - Add files that should not be in the repository (e.g., secrets, caches, log files) to the `.gitignore` file.
8. **Backup:**
   - Although Git is a version control system, it is a good practice to have backups of your repository, especially if Git is hosted locally.

## GitHub Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Repository Names:**
   - Names should hint at the project's purpose or content.
2. **Add a `README.md`:**
   - Always include a `README.md` file in your repositories. It should explain the project, how to set it up, how to install dependencies, how to contribute, and other relevant information. Note that the `README.md` name is written in uppercase letters.
3. **Use Issue and Pull Request Templates:**
   - Templates guide contributors to provide necessary information when creating issues or pull requests.
4. **Protect Your Main Branch:**
   - Use branch protection rules to ensure that the `main` or `master` branch cannot be pushed to directly and require pull request reviews before merging.
5. **Use Labels:**
   - Organize issues and pull requests with labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`).
6. **Code Reviews:**
   - Always review pull requests before merging. This ensures better code quality and consistency as the code is reviewed by more than one person.
7. **Communicate with the Community:**
   - Respond to issues and pull requests in a timely manner. Thank and encourage contributors, even if their contributions are not added to the project.
8. **Use GitHub Actions:**
   - Automate testing, building, and deployment processes with GitHub Actions.
9. **Keep Personal Data Out of the Repository:**
   - Never store sensitive information like **passwords**, **API keys**, or **secrets** in your repositories. Use GitHub's secrets feature or external tools like environment variables for this purpose.
10. **Regularly Review Permissions and Access:**
    - Ensure that only necessary contributors have access to your repository.

Following these best practices ensures that your use of Git and GitHub is effective, your project history remains meaningful and organized, and collaboration is smooth and productive.
