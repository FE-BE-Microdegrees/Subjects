- Identify the objectives and benefits of a persona;
- Create a persona in the context of software development.

## What is a Persona?

In the context of software development and user experience design, a **persona** is a fictional character that represents a specific type of user. **Personas** are created based on research and data about real users and are used to help designers and developers understand their users and their needs, goals, and behaviors.

A **persona** typically includes information about the user's demographics (such as age, gender, and occupation), as well as details about their interests, motivations, and behaviors. A **persona** may also include information about the user's goals, frustrations, and pain points, as well as details about their preferred methods of interacting with the software or application.

**Personas** are used to create empathy and assist designers and developers in making decisions based on user needs and preferences. By understanding the needs and behaviors of different types of users, designers can create interfaces and experiences that are tailored to their target audience, resulting in software that is more engaging, usable, and effective.

## Brief Overview of a Persona

- A sample user, an archetype of a typical end-user, representing a specific user group;
- Created to better understand the client – what motivates them, what irritates them, what do they need?
- Does not replace user research but is based on it!
- Helps keep the end-user's needs in mind during design, e.g., distinguishing essential functionalities from non-essential ones.

## Creating a Persona

To create a persona, a team typically gathers information using research methods such as:

- Surveys;
- Interviews;
- Observations of real users.

This information is then used to create a fictional character that embodies the key characteristics of the target audience.

When creating personas, it is essential to consider the goals of the software or application, as well as the characteristics of the target audience. For example, if the software is intended for medical professionals, personas are likely to include information about their job responsibilities, level of expertise, and preferred methods of interacting with the software. On the other hand, if the software is intended for a younger audience, personas may include information about their technology usage, interests, and social behaviors.

Once personas are created, they can be used throughout the design and development process to make design decisions, assess user needs, and test software usability. By using personas, teams can create software that is more effective, engaging, and user-centric, ultimately leading to greater satisfaction and success for both users and developers.

## What Does a Persona Describe?

- General Information
  - Name;
  - Age and gender;
  - Location;
  - Education and occupation;
  - Family status, etc.
- Picture and Quote
  - A picture speaks more than words – a photo humanizes the persona. Try to find a picture that describes your persona's personality;
  - A quote gives the persona a voice. It should definitely be related to your product/service.
- Personality, Typology
  - Describing the persona's personality helps understand them better;
  - Describe traits relevant to your product/service (e.g., independent vs. needing support; consistent vs. unstable, etc.)
- Goals, Objectives
  - Only motivation related to the given service/product!
  - What do they want to achieve? What is important to them?
  - What might lead them to the service/product? What do they want?
- Pain Points, Concerns
  - Only problems related to the given service/product!
  - What prevents them from achieving their goals? What are their worries and fears?
  - How do they overcome obstacles?

## Types of Personas

- **Proto-persona**: Not based on new research. The goal is to quickly create a sketch or overview of existing assumptions!
- **Qualitative Persona**: Based on small-scale studies (e.g., interviews, observations). The goal is an in-depth understanding of clients!
- **Quantitative Persona**: Based on large-scale studies (e.g., statistics, surveys). The goal is to personify data!
