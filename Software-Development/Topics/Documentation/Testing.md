# Example of Testing Documentation

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** Online Assignment Tracking System

The testing documentation contains all the essential details regarding the testing process of the system to ensure its quality and compliance with requirements. The documentation includes the scope, objectives, methodology, and test cases for testing.

## 2. Testing Objectives and Scope

The objective of testing is to ensure that the Online Assignment Tracking System meets all the requirements, works correctly, and is secure for users. The testing will focus on the following areas:

- **Functional Testing:** Ensuring that all features work according to the specifications.
- **Non-functional Testing:** Evaluating system performance, scalability, and usability.
- **Security Testing:** Ensuring that the system’s data is protected and access controls are functioning correctly.

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1. Functional Testing

- **Registration and Login:** Verifying that users can register and log in to the system using valid credentials.
- **Role-Based Access:** Ensuring that teachers and students only have access to their designated functions.
- **Assignment Management:** Verifying that teachers can create, modify, and assign tasks, and that students can respond to them.

### 3.2. Non-functional Testing

- **Performance Testing:** Testing the system under heavy load (up to 500 concurrent users) to ensure its reliability.
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluators will assess whether the system’s user interface is intuitive and easy to use.

### 3.3. Security Testing

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring that only authorized users can access the system and that role-based permissions are correctly implemented.
- **Data Protection:** Testing whether user data and passwords are securely encrypted.

## 5. Testing Tools and Environment

- **Testing Tools:** Postman for API testing, Selenium for automated tests, and JMeter for performance testing.
- **Testing Environment:** Testing will be conducted in a dedicated environment that mirrors the production environment to ensure realistic results.

## 6. Bug and Issue Tracking

All bugs and issues found during testing will be logged in the bug tracking system (e.g., Jira). Each bug will be classified according to its severity (critical, high, medium, low) and assigned to developers for resolution.

## 7. Testing Schedule

Testing will be conducted in the following phases:

1. **Functional Testing:** 2 weeks
2. **Non-functional Testing:** 1 week
3. **Security Testing:** 1 week

## 8. Summary

The testing documentation ensures that the system development adheres to quality standards and that all features and security aspects are thoroughly checked. Continuous testing helps ensure that the system is ready for use and meets all requirements.
