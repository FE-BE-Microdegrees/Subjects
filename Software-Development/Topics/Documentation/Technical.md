# Example of Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview of System Architecture

**Project Name:** Online Assignment Tracking System

The system is a web-based solution composed of multiple modules, including authentication, task management, and feedback submission. The system's architecture is divided into client-side and server-side components, with database management included.

## 2. Architecture Overview

- **Client-side Component:** The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures that the user experience is intuitive and responsive.
- **Server-side Component:** The server application is built using the Node.js framework, utilizing Express.js. It processes all requests from the client and directs them to the appropriate services.
- **Database:** The system uses a relational database, PostgreSQL, which stores user data, assignments, feedback, and other essential records.
- **API:** The system provides a RESTful API that allows third-party applications and the client interface to communicate with the server.

## 3. System Components

### 3.1. Authentication and Authorization

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register in the system using their email and password. JWT (JSON Web Token) protocol is used for user authentication.
- **Role-Based Access:** The system has two rolesâ€”teacher and student. Role-based access controls which features and data users can access.

### 3.2. Assignment Management

- **Creating and Modifying Assignments:** Teachers can add, modify, and set deadlines for assignments. These actions are performed through the user interface, which sends the appropriate requests to the server's API.
- **Student Responses:** Students can submit their responses to assignments by uploading files and filling in the required forms. All responses are stored in the database.

### 3.3. Feedback and Grading

- **Providing Feedback:** Teachers can grade and provide feedback on submitted assignments. Feedback is immediately available to the student once it is saved in the database.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- **Server:** Node.js (v16.x or newer), Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (v13 or newer)
- **API:** RESTful API supporting JSON-formatted data transmission
- **Client-side Interface:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (using the React framework)
- **Security:** User data and passwords are protected using bcrypt hashing, and JWT is used for securing sessions.

## 5. Installation Instructions

1. **Install Node.js and PostgreSQL:** Ensure that Node.js and PostgreSQL are installed on the server.
2. **Clone the Code:** Clone the project code from the GitHub repository.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. **Set Up Database:** Create a PostgreSQL database and run the initial data script.
5. **Environment Variables:** Set the required environment variables in the `.env` file, including database connection data and the JWT secret key.
6. **Start the Application:** Run the server with the command `npm start`.

## 6. Logging and Error Tracking

- **Logging:** The system uses logging to track events and errors. Log files can be used to analyze the system's performance and any issues. Logs are stored in files configured according to the environment variables.
- **Error Tracking:** The application includes error handling mechanisms that send error reports to the administrator and the logging system.

## 7. System Maintenance

- **Backups:** Database backups are performed automatically every day to prevent data loss.
- **Updates:** System components, including dependencies, should be updated regularly to ensure security and support for the latest features.
