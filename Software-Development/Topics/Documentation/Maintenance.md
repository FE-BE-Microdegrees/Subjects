# Example of Maintenance and Support Guide

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** Online Assignment Tracking System

The maintenance and support guide describes how to keep the system running smoothly, update components, create backups, and provide user support. This guide is intended for system administrators and maintenance personnel to ensure system stability and user satisfaction.

## 2. Maintenance Procedures

### 2.1. System Updates

- **Component Updates:** Regularly check for the latest versions of Node.js, PostgreSQL, and other dependencies. To ensure the security and performance of the system, all updates should be made in a testing environment before being applied to the production environment.
- **Code Updates:** Clone the latest version of the code repository and deploy it to the production environment. Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to ensure traceability of all changes.

### 2.2. Backups

- **Database Backup:** Use PostgreSQL backup tools to create automatic backups at least once a day. Store backups in a secure location to ensure data restoration in case of unforeseen issues.
- **Code Backup:** Ensure all code is backed up in a Git repository. Track changes and ensure that all important updates are properly documented.

### 2.3. Log Management

- **Logging:** All events and errors are logged in the system. Regularly check log files to detect potential issues and prevent system failures.
- **Log Cleaning:** Removing older logs helps maintain system performance and prevents storage issues. Configure an automatic log cleaning mechanism to keep only the most recent logs.

## 3. User Support

### 3.1. Support Services

- **Email Support:** Users can contact the support team via email at <support@assignmenttracking.com>. Respond to user inquiries and issues as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours.
- **Phone Support:** Users have the option to call support weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM at +372 123 4567. Ensure someone is always available to help users resolve their issues promptly.

### 3.2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **How to reset your password?** Users can reset their password by clicking the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page and following the instructions.
- **What to do if an assignment is not visible?** If an assignment is not visible, the user should check if they are logged in correctly and if the assignment has been assigned to their group.

## 4. Preventive Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring:** Use performance monitoring tools such as Prometheus or Grafana to track the systemâ€™s performance and avoid potential bottlenecks.
- **Security Updates:** Regularly install security patches for both the operating system and software components to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure system security.

## 5. Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily Maintenance:** Check logs and create database backups.
- **Weekly Maintenance:** Check system performance and perform necessary optimizations.
- **Monthly Maintenance:** Update system components, test new functionalities, and apply security patches.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues:** If users report login issues, check if the password is entered correctly and if the user account is active.
- **Bug Fixing:** All detected bugs are logged in the issue tracking system (e.g., Jira). Fix bugs according to their severity, and make changes in the testing environment before deploying them to the production environment.

## 7. Summary

The maintenance and support guide helps system administrators ensure system stability and security while providing necessary support to users. Regular maintenance and preventive measures are key to keeping the system running smoothly and user-friendly.
