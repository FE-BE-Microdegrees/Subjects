# Back-End Frameworks

Back-end frameworks provide an in-depth exploration of modern methods, tools, and best practices for developing server-side applications. Learners will dive into essential concepts such as routing, middleware, authentication, and database operations. Throughout the course, students will engage in practical projects, creating performance-oriented and secure applications ready for real-world scenarios. This journey will also introduce them to a comprehensive toolkit and ecosystem associated with modern back-end application development.

## Description

- **Credits**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Course Objectives**: The aim of the course is to develop learners' skills in using modern back-end frameworks to create robust, scalable, and secure server-side applications.

By the end of the course, students should be proficient in the principles of server architecture, API development, database integration, and the broader ecosystem related to modern back-end application development.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Server Architecture**: Understand and implement server architectures using framework capabilities to structure scalable applications.
- **Routing and Middleware**: Utilize routing mechanisms to handle different types of requests and implement middleware for request/response processing.
- **Database Integration**: Connect server-side applications to relational and non-relational databases, perform CRUD operations, and understand ORM/ODM paradigms.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement strategies for securing applications with authentication and authorization, understanding sessions, tokens, and OAuth mechanisms.
- **API Development**: Design and develop RESTful APIs, emphasizing best practices in endpoint structure, data validation, and error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling strategies to manage and respond to various error types and scenarios.
- **Deployment and Production**: Familiarize with deployment processes, environment configurations, and the nuances involved in bringing a back-end application to production.
- **Security Measures**: Implement various security measures, understanding potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and protecting against them.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Understand the CI/CD pipeline and integrate it into the workflow of back-end application development.
