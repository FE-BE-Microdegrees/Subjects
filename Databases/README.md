## Description

The Databases course provides an overview of the principles of database design, creation, and implementation. Students gain practical skills in using MySQL databases for their application's back end. During the course, students will learn how to create a database with proper data types, tables, and relationships for the back end, write functional database queries, and implement a relational database in their applicationâ€™s back end.

- **Credits**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Course Objectives**: To acquire an overview and practical skills in designing, creating, and implementing MySQL databases.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the student will be able to:

- Create a database for the back end with correct data types, tables, and relationships.
- Write functional database queries for use in the database.
- Implement a relational database in the back end of the application.
