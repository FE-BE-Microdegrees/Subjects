# Seventh Lecture

After recalling the topics from previous lectures, we will continue with the topics of using `VS Code` extensions and the command line.

On the programming side, we will discuss modules and their usage.

## Topics

### Software Development

- [VS Code Extensions and Tips](../../../Software-Development/Topics/VSCode-Tips/README.md)
- [Using the Command Line (_terminal_)](../../../Software-Development/Topics/Command-Line/README.md)

### Programming

- Modules
  - [Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules/README.md)
  - [Built-in Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules-Built-In/README.md)
  - [Third-party Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules-Third-Party/README.md)

## Homework - Deadline: Before the next lecture

- Read through today's lecture materials:
  - [Self-created Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules/README.md)
  - [Third-party Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules-Third-Party/README.md)
- Complete the exercises in the materials:
  - [Self-created Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules/README.md)
  - [Third-party Modules](../../../Programming-Basics/Topics/Modules-Third-Party/README.md)
  - Optionally, you can also improve the `TODO` app created in the lecture:
    - Add validation to check if the task is provided when adding a new `TODO` - if not, display an appropriate message.
    - Add validation to check if a task with the selected `id` exists when changing the task status - if not, display an appropriate message.
    - Make the task list display more visually appealing (instead of showing just an array of objects, display tasks individually).
    - Differentiate tasks that are completed from those that are not (using colors).
    - Add an option to display only completed or only incomplete tasks.
- Submit the homework through a code review (`Code review`)
