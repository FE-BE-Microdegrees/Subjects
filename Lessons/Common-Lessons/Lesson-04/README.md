# Fourth Lecture

In the fourth lecture, we will first recall what we did and discussed in the previous lectures. Then, we will review the issues that arose with the homework assignments and look at how to resolve them. We will continue with topics on software development, discuss code quality, code reviews, documentation, and conclude with an introduction to best practices in software development.

On the programming side, we will discuss data structures, particularly objects, and perform exercises related to objects.
